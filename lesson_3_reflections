When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    By doing this people in different locations are able to make changes to the same file and share their versions through remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   It is more flexible. I can decide when to pull the file from the remote repository. It also helps if I want to keep my personal version. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
